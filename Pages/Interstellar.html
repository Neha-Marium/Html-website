                <strong><em>Interstellar</em></strong> is a 2014 epic science-fiction film co-written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. 
                It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. 
                Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through 
                a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.

            <p>
                In 2067, ex-NASA pilot Cooper is forced to work as a farmer due to a global famine caused by blight. 
                The famine is severe enough that it has had major effects on human society, including the abandonment of any scientific 
                pursuit that is not directly related to solving the world's food problem. Government-run schools actively discourage students 
                from studying subjects such as space exploration, claiming that historical events like the moon landing were a political hoax 
                and that scientific organizations such as NASA were shut down due to a belief that it was a waste of money and resources.

                Cooper ignores his daughter, Murph, when she claims a ghost is communicating to her through her bookshelf, but later finds 
                dust particles forming an inexplicable pattern on Murph's bedroom floor. He investigates, and is led to a secret government 
                facility where Professor Brand explains that NASA was not actually shut down, but rather has been secretly tasked by the 
                government to explore the possibility of finding humanity a new home away from Earth. Blight, dust storms, and failing crops 
                have rendered humans incapable of surviving. Brand claims to be working on a gravity equation to make this mission possible 
                and asks Cooper to pilot an exploratory spacecraft. Cooper agrees, promising a distraught Murph that he will return. 
                He pilots a shuttle carrying scientists Romilly, Doyle, and Brandâ€™s daughter Amelia to dock with the spacecraft 
                <em>Endurance</em>. The ship is headed towards a wormhole that mysteriously appeared near Saturn decades ago.

                The <em>Endurance</em> passes through the wormhole into another galaxy with a planetary system orbiting a supermassive 
                black hole called <em><strong>Gargantua</strong></em> The crew intends to investigate three planets, each previously explored by NASA 
                volunteers, who shared positive reports for habitability. The first planet is an aqua planet with massive tidal waves and 
                no dry land. Doyle drowns after failing to get into the probe and getting knocked off by one of the waves, and Amelia and 
                Cooper fly back to the Endurance, only to find that decades have passed due to the time slippage caused by the planet's 
                proximity to <em><strong>Gargantua</strong></em>. Romilly, having remained onboard, has aged 23 years. Cooper replays messages from Earth, 
                learning that Murph is now his age and has become a scientist working with Brand.

            <p>
                The crew journeys to the second planet to find the previous NASA explorer, Mann, is still alive and has established a base. 
                On earth, Murph learns from a dying Professor Brand that he gave up on solving his gravity equation years ago, because it 
                would take data from inside a black hole to reconcile, which is impossible to achieve. He reveals that he never intended 
                for their mission to evacuate humanity from earth to succeed, and was instead planning for Cooper and his fellow astronauts 
                to try to establish their own colony and hopefully restart the human race themselves. He dies, and a distraught Murph 
                relays this information to the crew. As they explore the second planet, they discover that Mann falsified the data in his 
                reports so that the NASA mission would come rescue him. Romilly is killed by Mann's booby trap when he tries to access the 
                logs, and Mann attempts to hijack the <em>Endurance</em>, but fails to dock properly, blowing out the hatch and killing himself in 
                the process. Cooper and Amelia catch up with the damaged <em>Endurance</em> and dock safely.

                With limited resources available to use their engines, Cooper proposes a slingshot move around Gargantua, using its gravity 
                to propel them toward the final planet. To shed mass, Cooper sacrifices himself at the last minute, dropping into the black 
                hole and leaving Amelia to complete the journey. Falling past the event horizon, Cooper finds himself inside a 
                five-dimensional tesseract. He deduces that it was placed there by future humans with access to higher dimensions, as was 
                the wormhole. He realizes that by using gravity, he is able to send messages to Murph and his past self. On Earth, Murph 
                visits her childhood house after Professor Brand's death. She finds her father's old watch on her bookshelf, and notices 
                the seconds-hand moving irregularly. She initially believes her "ghost" is back, only to realize that it was Cooper all 
                along, sending her messages from a higher dimension. Cooper feeds Murph scientific data about the black hole's 
                <em>singularity</em>, which she eventually uses to solve the gravity equation, helping humanity escape Earth.

                His mission is now complete, and Cooper is ejected by future beings from the tesseract. He is sent back through the wormhole 
                and picked up by a ranger orbiting Saturn. Due to the time slippage around Gargantua, almost 90 years have passed in Earth 
                time since Cooper left, though he has barely aged. He awakens on a cylindrical space station and reunites with Murph, now a 
                celebrated scientist who helped humans survive extinction. Nearing death, she advises Cooper not to wait around to see her die, 
                and urges him to find Amelia, who may have settled on the other planet that could become their new home. Cooper steals a 
                spacecraft and sets off on his new journey. On the other planet, Amelia is building a new colony for future humans to 
                inhabit. She removes her helmet and breathes the air, showing that the planet is capable of supporting life.
