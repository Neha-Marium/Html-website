                <strong><em>Oblivion</em></strong> is a 2013 American post-apocalyptic action-adventure film co-produced and directed 
                by Joseph Kosinski, and produced by Peter Chernin with screenplay by Karl Gajdusek and Michael deBruyn, starring Tom 
                Cruise in the main role alongside Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Melissa 
                Leo in supporting roles. Oblivion, based on Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel of the same name, pays homage to 1970s 
                science fiction. <em>Oblivion</em> is set in 2077, on an Earth desolated by war. A technician is on a mission against remaining 
                scavenger extraterrestrials, but after he rescues a woman from a spaceship crash, he learns that the scavengers are the 
                people who survived the alien threat.

            <p>
                Jack Harper and Victoria are the last people left on Earth in 2077. In 2017, a race of scavenger aliens had decimated 
                the <em>Moon</em> and invaded the ruined Earth; although humans won the war, Earth was made inhospitable. With Victoria as his 
                communications officer, Jack fixes combat drones that hunt the remaining scavengers and guard the hydroelectric 
                platforms that convert seawater into fusion energy. The couple reports to Sally, the mission commander aboard the 
                "Tet", a space station that orbits the earth once a day like a harvest moon, staying connected "online" during the day. 
                They will depart for Titan to rejoin the rest of humanity within two weeks. Though Jack and Victoria's memories have 
                been wiped, Jack recognizes his past life through memories that occasionally appear during the day as visions, and 
                during the night in dreams -- a pre-war life in the company of an unknown woman with long dark hair.

                Jack escapes a scavenger trap while searching for a disabled drone in the New York Public Library's ruins, but a 
                hydroelectric platform is destroyed. He discovers that the scavengers are radioing coordinates from the Empire State 
                Building's antenna, and ends the transmission into outer space. He visits a secret lakeside cabin he has built and 
                filled with mementos of Earth's past. An unidentified object falls into the transmitted coordinates. Jack investigates 
                the crash site and finds five humans in delta-sleep pods, including the woman in his dreams. Although a drone destroys 
                the other pods, Jack is able to protect the woman and carries her to his base. He and Victoria revive her and learn she 
                is Julia Rusakova, a NASA astronaut who has been sleeping aboard the spaceship Odyssey since 2017.

                Jack and Julia return to the crash to retrieve the Odyssey's flight recorder, but they are captured by scavengers and 
                taken to the Raven Rock Mountain Complex. The leader there, Malcolm Beech, reveals that the scavengers are human 
                survivors who have been hiding from drones, wearing protective suits since drones target human shapes and voices. 
                Beech frees Jack and Julia into the desert Jack knows as the Radiation Zone to discover the truth for themselves. 
                Julia reveals that she is Jack's wife; this revelation reminds him of his marriage proposal at the Empire State Building.

                Victoria is heartbroken to see the closeness between Jack and Julia when she sends an aircraft to retrieve them. 
                So she reports the situation to Sally, who sends a drone which kills Victoria before Julia can destroy it and save Jack. 
                Jack and Julia flee in the jet and destroy the drones chasing them before crashing in the desert. Nearby, a clone of 
                Jack arrives to fix disabled drones. Jack incapacitates him, but Julia is shot during their fight. Jack impersonates 
                the clone to return to the clone's base for medical supplies, where he encounters a clone of Victoria. He takes Julia 
                to his cabin, where she recovers and tells him that it was built according to the rural lakeside cabin they had lived 
                in in 2017. They conclude that what makes them a couple is true love.

                They return to Raven Rock with the promise that they will return to the cabin alive once the war is over. 
                Malcolm tells them that the Tet is an alien ship with an artificial intelligence. Determined to extract Earth's natural 
                resources, the Tet decimated the Moon and invaded Earth with an army of clones of Jack. The escape to Titan and 
                humanity's victory is fictional. The survivors had to bring down the spaceship Odyssey to obtain its nuclear reactor, 
                which is suitable for interplanetary travel. Jack reprograms a captured drone to sabotage the Tet with a bomb, but 
                other drones attack the base. Malcolm is gravely injured and the captured drone is damaged beyond repair. Jack and 
                Julia volunteer to deliver a bomb manually. They admire the painting of Christina's World (1948), then say goodbye with 
                a kiss filled with a lifetime of missed kisses before Julia climbs into her pod.

                En route, Jack listens to the Odyssey's flight recorder and learns that he is a clone of the NASA mission commander 
                sent to explore Titan. Victoria was his co-pilot, Julia was the newest crew member, and Sally was the Earth mission 
                director. After the mission was interrupted by the appearance of the Tet, Jack separated the control capsule to save 
                the crew members in their pods. He and Victoria were captured and cloned. Victoria had been jealous of the relationship 
                Jack had had with Julia, so Victoria's clone had manipulated Jack's clone into thinking they were a romantic couple. 
                Jack enters the Tet and finds thousands of clones of him and Victoria in stasis. The Tet's projection of Sally 
                confronts Jack. Jack offers Julia to Sally, but while Jack repeats a quote from the classics about dying well, Malcolm 
                emerges from the hibernation pod instead. They detonate the bomb, destroying the Tet and themselves. Julia wakes up in 
                her pod by the cabin and is surprised to see the bucolic painting in an envelope with her.

            <p>
                Three years after seeing the Tet's explosion in the sky, Julia is raising a daughter at the cabin, where the canvas is 
                framed, when they meet with surviving resistance members. These humans are accompanied by the clone Jack had subdued in 
                the desert, who has recovered the original Jack's memories.
