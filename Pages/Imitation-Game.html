                <strong><em>The Imitation Game</em></strong> is a 2014 American historical drama film directed by Morten Tyldum and 
                written by Graham Moore, based on the 1983 biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges. The film's title quotes 
                the name of the game cryptanalyst Alan Turing proposed for answering the question "Can machines think?", in his 1950 
                seminal paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, who decrypted 
                German intelligence messages for the British government during World War II. Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory 
                Kinnear, Charles Dance, and Mark Strong appear in supporting roles.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>
                In 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent break-in at his 
                home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.
                In 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, 
                who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from 
                tuberculosis. When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of 
                Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith 
                Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are trying to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded 
                messages.

                Turing is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design a machine to 
                decipher <em>Enigma</em> messages. After Denniston refuses to fund the construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime 
                Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and 
                Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, 
                passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her 
                to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages and shares his plans with her. With Clarke's help, 
                Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.

                Turing's machine, which he names <em>Christopher</em>, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption 
                settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the 
                other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing 
                proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who 
                warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives from the 
                same German coder, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist 
                in certain messages. One German coder always opens his first message with a standard plaintext German script. That 
                reveals enough of the day's Enigma code that Christopher can quickly decode all the day's messages. After he 
                recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. They learn a convoy is about 
                to be attacked, but Turing realises that if they suddenly reroute the convoy and attack the U-boats, the Germans will 
                realize Enigma is compromised and change the machinery. Therefore, the team at Bletchley Park cannot act on every 
                decoded message. Turing creates a statistical model to indicate which warnings to send to maximize destruction and 
                minimize discovery.

                Turing discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are 
                allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the top MI6 agent 
                Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this 
                already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing 
                tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a homosexual. Clarke states she always suspected but insists 
                they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her 
                cryptography skills. Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she will 
                undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions. After 
                the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work, because MI6 wants governments to think they had 
                unbreakable code machines. He tells the team that they should never see one another again or share what they have done.

                In 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes chemical castration so he 
                can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts 
                him by saying that his work saved millions of lives. The epilogue reveals that after a year of government-mandated 
                hormonal therapy, Turing committed suicide on June 7, 1954. In 2013, <em>Queen Elizabeth II</em> granted Turing a 
                posthumous Royal Pardon, honouring his work which would eventually go on to create the modern computer.
